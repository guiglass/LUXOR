  - Yes, there is a basic locomotion system for animating the avatar's lower body when no feet or hip trackers are preset.

- Q: How do we move around in Luxor? Can we do so while recording?
  - There includes several ways users may move about the scene. There are controls located on the main menu for moving the playspace or scaling the avatar:
  <p align="center">
  <a href="/img/slew controls.png">
     <img width="15%" height="15%" src="/img/slew controls.png">
  </a>
	This panel becomes hidden during recording.

  It is possible to use superhero fly mode while recording, and if used in combination with raycast floor the avatar will remain attached to any floor coliders.
