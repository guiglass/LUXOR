## Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirements for APS Luxor is SteamVR with two controllers and an HMD. Vive trackers are optional. If you're using a Kinect instead of trackers then the avatar's hands will still target the controllers, the Kinect only provides tracking points for the feet and hip.
