## Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirements for APS Luxor are a SteamVR or Oculus HMD with two controllers. However APS Luxor may also be used in (NO VR) mode requiring a minimum of only trackers for head and hands targets, so Vive trackers may be used exclusively but are optional. If you're using a Kinect and [driver4vr](https://www.driver4vr.com) instead of physical Vive trackers then the avatar's hands may still target the controllers and the Kinect only provides tracking points for the feet and hip.

It is now possible to use APS Luxor with only a Oclulus Quest 2, one option is to use [Virtual Desktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net) to play APS Luxor as a SteamVR game. The other option is to use the Luxor Quest finger tracking app for Oculus Quest 2 which can provide finger, head and hands tracking data for connecting to the avatar.
