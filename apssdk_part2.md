## Creating a simple prop:

Start Blender to begin a new project. Once the viewport has completed loading you may delete the cube and light from the default scene.

  </a>
  <sub><sup>For consistency it is important the Blender be set to use the proper units. From Scene Properties be sure that the unit for length is set to meters.
</sup></sub>

With a complete empty scene go ahead and add a sphere then give it a name. 

In this example I am modeling a (ITF) standard tennis ball which conforms to a diameter of 6.54cm.

It is highly recomended that all models be to scale and that the scale be applied at (1,1,1) for all objects:

  <sub><sup>I have also unwrapped a basic UV texture onto the sphere to make it appear more like a tennis ball for adding more immersion during mocap. However it is not necessary to include textures at this step and texturing can be accomplished later on prior to final rendering.</sup></sub>
