## Creating a simple prop:

Start Blender to begin a new project. Once the viewport has completed loading you may delete the cube and light from the default scene.

  </a>
   <br>
  <sub><sup>For consistency it is important the Blender be set to use the proper units. From Scene Properties be sure that the unit for length is set to meters.
</sup></sub>
  </p>
With a complete empty scene go ahead and add a sphere then give it a name. 

In this example I am modeling a (ITF) standard tennis ball which conforms to a diameter of 6.54cm.

It is recommended that all models be to-scale and that the scale be applied as (1,1,1) for all objects:

  <sub><sup>I have also unwrapped a basic UV texture onto the mesh to make it appear more like a tennis ball for adding immersion during mocap.
