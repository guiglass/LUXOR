APS Luxor is a motion capture tool that was originally developed for use as a VR training simulator but has quickly evolved into a highly configurable motion capture utility capable of recording simultanious full body tracking, facial and eye tracking, finger tracking, audio and visemes lipsync, dynamicBone simulation capture and a improved IK solvers with profiles that can be tuned for creating unique or natural motion and expression. And users may include custom scenes, objs, props and most humaniod avatars are compatible using the APSSDK for generating assets from the very popular Unity Editor. Users may add custom avarars incuding custom shaders or dynamicBone components for adding physics simulations which may be recorded and exported into Blender with automation to instantly load entire scene compilations so artists coudld start rendering in minutes. And through much colabortaion, hard work and a generous community to offer feedback and ideas for new features this tool has evolved into a very customizable swiss army knife of features for artists, game develelopers, eduicators and entertainers to create quality motion capture content quickly and using standard consumer VR hardware. Luxor can be used both live and for recording and expoirt mocap using custom avatars, and is bundled with automation to help export entire animated scenes automatically and build them into Blender scenes so artists can begin rendering (even complex) scenes using EEVEE engine in minutes. And with recent feature added Luxor now offers the ability to functon only needing tracker instead of requiring an HMD, this allows more flexibility and users may add head trackers in place of their HMDs.

Here I will try explain the features and techniques for getting started and using APS Luxor as a tool for creating motion capture in VR from custom avatars which then is auto imported to a Blender scene and can be ready for rendering within minutes of recording. Later I will also try to show examples of using Luxor for live productions such as streaming avatars, live presentations and VTuber community.
