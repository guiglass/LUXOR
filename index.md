APS LUXOR is a motion capture tool that was originally developed as a VR training simulator and has quickly evolved into a highly configurable motion capture utility capable of recording or live streaming many types of custom avatars while using simultanious full body tracking, eye tracking, facial tracking, finger tracking, audio and visemes lipsync, dynamicBone simulation capture and with improved IK solvers and profiles that can be tuned for creating unique or natural motion and expression. Users may also include custom scenes, objs, props and most humaniod avatars are compatible using the APSSDK for generating assets from the very popular Unity Editor. Users may add custom avatars incuding custom shaders with dynamicBone *physics* components which may be recorded and exported into Blender along with automation to instantly load entire scene compliations so that artists can begin rendering in minutes. And through much colabortaion and hard work with a lot of generous community contributions offering feedback and wonderful ideas for feature requests I have aspired to create a mocap tool designed and taylored for mocap artists and game develelopers, educators and entertainers and all those who wish to create quality motion capture content quickly and using only standard consumer VR hardware. LUXOR can be used both live and/or for recording and exporting mocap using custom avatars. LUXOR offers a lot of built in automation to help with exporting entire animated scenes and automatically building them to Blender scenes to begin rendering (even complex) scenes in Blender in minutes. And with recent feature added LUXOR now offers the ability to connect avatars entirely to trackers instead of requiring an HMD, this allows more flexibility so that users may calibrate using a head trackers in place of the HMD.

Here I will try explain the features and techniques for getting started and using APS LUXOR as a tool for creating motion capture in VR from custom avatars which then is auto imported to a Blender scene and can be ready for rendering within minutes of recording. Later I will also try to show examples of using LUXOR for live productions such as streaming avatars, live presentations and VTuber community.
