Creators are welcome to join the [APS Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ErZcKaQ) - For tech support, latest updates, tips, ideas, showcasing and sharing/viewing community content or speaking with developers.

I will try to go over some of the features and techniques for getting started and using APS Luxor as a tool for creating motion capture in VR from custom avatars which then is auto imported to a Blender scene and can be ready for rendering within minutes of recording. Later I will also try to show examples of using Luxor for live productions such as streaming avatars, live presentations and VTuber community.
