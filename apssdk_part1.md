**Installing the ASP SDK into a new Unity project**



Download [Unity 2019.4](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.16)
 - Unity 2020 is not supported!
 - The APS SDK is compatible with Unity 2018.4.20f1 for users who are also working with the VRCSDK.


Download the latest [APS_SDK.unitypackage](https://github.com/guiglass/LUXOR/blob/gh-pages/APS_SDK.unitypackage?raw=true)

After installing Unity and opeining Unity hub click on New project and ensure to have selected the proper Unity version from the dropdown:

<sub>You may optionally wish to consider sticking to a standardized naming convention such as prepending <b>APS_SDK_</b> to the begining of the project's name whenever creating a project to be used for building assets. The project name should also take into consideration if it will be used for creating an individual asset or batches of assets. For example, whenever I start a project for creating assets in batches I will typically name the project something similar to <b>APS_SDK_BATCH_</b>MyCoolAssets.
